Personal Data

Description
This project focuses on understanding and handling personal data in a secure manner. It covers the key concepts of data privacy, protection, and regulations surrounding the use of personal data. The project aims to teach best practices for managing personal information, implementing security measures, and ensuring compliance with data protection laws.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn:

What personal data is and why it needs protection.
Best practices for handling and storing personal data.
The principles of data minimization, anonymization, and pseudonymization.
How to comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR.
How to implement security measures to protect personal data.
The importance of logging and monitoring access to personal data.
Requirements
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.
All your files should end with a new line.
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3.
A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.7.x).
All your files must be executable.
Project Tasks
Task 0: Write a function that redacts the fields of a log message containing personal data.
Description: Implement a function that will redact personal data from a log message before it is logged. The function should replace sensitive fields with a placeholder to protect the user's privacy.

Example:

python
Copy code
def redact_sensitive_data(log_message: str) -> str:
    # Your implementation
    return redacted_message
Task 1: Log personal data handling actions in a secure manner.
Description: Develop a logging system that will record access to personal data, ensuring that the logs themselves do not expose sensitive information. You should ensure that all access to personal data is logged securely and comply with data protection regulations.

Task 2: Anonymize data using hashing or encryption.
Description: Implement a mechanism to anonymize personal data using either hashing or encryption techniques. Ensure that the data is still usable for analysis while being protected from unauthorized access.

Task 3: Implement a privacy policy statement.
Description: Create a privacy policy statement for a hypothetical company or application, outlining the handling, storage, and protection of personal data according to data protection laws and best practices.

Usage
To run the project scripts, ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system. Execute the scripts directly from the command line:

bash
Copy code
./your_script_name.py
